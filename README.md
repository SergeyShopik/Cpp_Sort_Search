# Cpp_Sort_Search
Calculations using different sort and search algorithms
1. Create function with default parameters taking three integers and prints all numbers between 0 and 1000 which are **multiples of the parameters**.
2. Create function which gets min array element. Use selection sort.
3. Create function which performs binary search of a new element placement in a sorted array
	 and returns the new element insertion place.
4. Function gets min array element. All elements by its left side are sorted in decreasing order, right side - increasing order.
   Returns min element index.
5. Function gets array element which has **minimal difference with arithmetic mean** of all array elements
   and sorts all elements by its left side in increasing order, right side - decreasing order.
   Returns element's index.
6. Function sorts array by element's last digit increasing order.
